# COVID_Queries
Querying the World COVID dataset

This was my first project, modeled loosely after the guided project by Alex the Analyst, using data from Our World In Data.  The dataset was uploaded into MySQL, which was also where I completed my queries.  Visualizations were completed in Tableau using views developed from my SQL querying.  This project was useful in practicing some of the features of SQL and Tableau.  In addition, it helped me learn new SQL language like PARTITION BY.
